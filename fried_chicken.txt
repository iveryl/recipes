Ingredients

1 broiler/fryer chicken, cut into 8 pieces
2 cups low fat buttermilk
2 tablespoons kosher salt
2 tablespoons Hungarian paprika
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Flour, for dredging
Vegetable shortening,or peanut oil for frying

Directions


1.  Place chicken pieces into a plastic container and cover with buttermilk.
    Cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.

2.  Melt enough shortening (over low heat) to come just 1/3-inch up the side
    of a 12-inch cast iron skillet or heavy fry pan. Once shortening liquefies
    raise heat to 325 degrees F.

3.  Do not allow oil to go over 325 degrees F.

4.  Drain chicken in a colander. Combine salt, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne
    pepper. Liberally season chicken with this mixture.

5.  Dredge chicken in flour and shake off excess.
    Place chicken skin side down into the pan. Put thighs in the center, and breast
    and legs around the edge of the pan. The oil should come half way up the pan.
    Cook chicken until golden brown on each side, approximately 10 to 12 minutes
    per side. More importantly, the internal temperature should be right around
    180 degrees. (Be careful to monitor shortening temperature every few minutes.)

6.  Drain chicken on a rack over a sheet pan. Don't drain by setting chicken
    directly on paper towels or brown paper bags. If you need to hold the chicken
    before serving, cover loosely with foil but avoid holding in a warm oven,
    especially if it's a gas oven.
